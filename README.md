Software Overview
This software is created using Python and TensorFlow, to examine and analysis plant satiability with linear regression machine learning, given rapidly changing climate and extremal bacterial factors.
Using machine learning, a precomposed data set is analysed to predicted plant growth rates and the ideal condition for plant growth and sustainability. Using the software alongside a camera, the plants are analyzed through pattern recognition and compared with previous data sets.
